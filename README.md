# ft_ssl_md5
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> This is the first ft_ssl project on the path of Encryption and Security.  You will recode some security technologies you may have already been using, from scratch.
>
> You will want to plan out the structure of your executable before you begin, because you will build directly onto it in later security projects. It is of vital importance that your functions are modular, your code is easy to re-use and adding onto the executable doesnâ€™t require rewriting the program.
>
> This project will focus specifically on cryptographic hashing algorithms to solidify your understanding of bitwise operations, integer overflow, and one-way functions. A subplot to this project is to emphasize writing clean code that can be efficiently extended.
